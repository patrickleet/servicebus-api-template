  // Servicebus is kinda lika an event emitter for your whole system.
  // You can emit an event in one service. Then you can listen for that event in another service.
  // It is also fault tolerant and scalable.
  // It's backed by RabbitMQ and Redis.
  // It's been used in production for years in financial transactions with large volumes, AI projects
  // and at least one blockchain based company.
  //
  // bus's have 4 main functions - send/listen for command and publish/subscribe for events
  //
  // It's also great for building systems with CQRS/ES.
  // Command Query Responsibility Segregation with Event Sourcing.

  // "log" is an instance of llog, a "leveled logger".
  // It's actually just logging with pino, but it is a singleton
  // so you don't need to create it elsewhere, which can throw off your logs
  // by saying the file it came from is the singleton file, which is much less helpful!
  //
  // I'm assuming your logging strategy is "log to stdout" and pick it up with an external tool.
  // Microservices shouldn't have to care about shipping logs.

  // make the bus available on the response object.
